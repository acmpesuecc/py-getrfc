# py-getrfc (A Python script to fetch RFCs)

Thank you for taking the time to check out my first open-source
project!


WORKING:
This script uses the `requests` module to get RFCs from the
IETF website.
On running the application, currently, it will input the rfc number and display all the pages regarding the same in the terminal.


USAGE:
main.py [-h] [-notall] [-tofile] [-name NAME] RFCno

Get RFC data from command line (input)


POSITIONAL ARGUEMENTS:
These are the arguements that dont have a default value. The program cannot be further executed if this arguement is not entered by the user.
In this case, the positional arguement is the rfc number whose information you want to display.

  RFCno       RFC Number that you want to get
  

OPTIONAL ARGUEMENTS:
These are the arguements the user does not necessarily have to enter. 
The program will continue running normally, even when these arguements are not inputed. 

  -h, --help  show this help message and exit
  -notall     specify if you want only first page
  -tofile     Specify if you want to write to a file or just display in shell
              (default - false)
  -name NAME  Name of a file you want to write to
  
  
  
HOW TO RUN THE PROGRAM:
 
 -The first step to leave the directory you are currently working in like this:
 
C:\Hacknight_getfrc\py-getrfc-master (1)\py-getrfc-master>cd..\..
C:\Hacknight_getfrc>cd..

 -The next step is to enter the appropriate directory as depicted:
 
C:\>cd "\Hacknight_getfrc\py-getrfc-master (1)\py-getrfc-master"\
C:\Hacknight_getfrc\py-getrfc-master (1)\py-getrfc-master>

 -Next, we need to run the program in command prompt while also giving in the necessary input.
  In this case, the input is the rfc number. Since this is a positional arguement, the program will throw an error if this arguement is not entered.
  
C:\Hacknight_getfrc\py-getrfc-master (1)\py-getrfc-master>python main.py 2306

 -Here, 2306 is the rfc number


EXAMPLE:
If the above steps are followed and the code is run, the output will be as follows:


Parsons & Rafferty           Informational                     [Page 23]

-It will display all 25 pages describing the rfc, this is just one of the pages for sample.
