# py-getrfc (A Python script to fetch RFCs)

Thank you for taking the time to check out my first open-source
project!


WORKING:
This script uses the `requests` module to get RFCs from the
IETF website.
On running the application, currently, it will input the rfc number and display all the pages regarding the same in the terminal.


USAGE:
main.py [-h] [-notall] [-tofile] [-name NAME] RFCno

Get RFC data from command line


POSITIONAL ARGUEMENTS:
  RFCno       RFC Number that you want to get
  

OPTIONAL ARGUEMENTS:
  -h, --help  show this help message and exit
  -notall     specify if you want only first page
  -tofile     Specify if you want to write to a file or just display in shell
              (default - false)
  -name NAME  Name of a file you want to write to
  

EXAMPLE:
If rfc number entered is 2306, the output will be as follows:


Parsons & Rafferty           Informational                     [Page 23]
