The `input` function is used inside the `if tofile` block to get the filename when `tofile` is true. 
However, the `input` function is used without prompting the user to enter the filename, which could result in an error. 

To fix this, I replaced the line:
filename = input("Please enter the file name to store RFC at: ")
with:
filename = Prompt.ask("Please enter the file name to store RFC at: ")

Also, I added some more comments and deleted unneccessary lines.
